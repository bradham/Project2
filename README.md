Project Two
Project Name:
Karjour


Karjour is a job search database geared towards job seekers that have just completed a coding bootcamp. 
Not only will job seekers be able to see available jobs located near them, they will also be able to use
the website for inspiration, encouragement and positive advice for those on their job hunting journey.


Karjour our full-stack web application makes the connection between the job seeker and the employer through job postings. 
Designed and build using the MVC paradigm and a server-side API, Karjour not only addresses the need to see available
positions but uses an enchanced feature of including emotional support that job seekers utilize as they face rejection
or feelings of inadequacy.Through testing, continuous integration and the use of linting tools our group has successfully
build a full-stack web application to confront this need within the codeing community.


Our group has designed, build and deployed a full-stack web application to Heroku.
We have implemented unit tests through linting and continuous integration of Travis CI.


Lisa Smithen has done the frontend design work.
Brad Ham has done project management, testing and authentication.
Anissa Bartley has constructed the database, testing and implementation of Sequelize.
